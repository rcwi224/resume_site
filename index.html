        <p class="lead mb-5">I am currently a student at the University of Kentucky planning to graduate in August 2020. As of now I am planning on graduating with a Bachelor of Science, taking the Technology Management track in the Information Communication Technology program. The bulk of my time at UK has been spent focusing on coding, visual design and general technology courses.</p>
		<p class="lead mb-5">I have had a passion for technology since a young age and  a growing desire to work in the field as I saw a variety of tech become increasingly influential in our everyday lives and society as a whole. Similarly, my hobby of graphic design  started early and I am now looking to hopefully combine my two passions in a variety of works, including web design. I am eager to learn more and get hands on experience in the field to help me develop a healthy skill set that would allow to me to contribute to the field in a worth while manner.</p>

            <p>Worked as attendant of Kroger Gas Station during the Summer of 2019. Was often only person at station and was responsible for ensuring sales of gas and kiosk went smoothly.

This position gave me a chance to display my strong skills with people as I interacted with them heavily during my shifts and my reliability as an employee as I worked primarily alone while overseeing operations of the station and ensuring money was safely and accurately counted and dropped into an onsite safe. </p>
